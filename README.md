# STEMS
STEMS is a HW architecture-mapping design space exploration  (DSE) framework for multi-layer SNN mapping. STEMS applies inter-layer optimizations across SNN spatial and temporal dimensions.  STEMS is built on top of Stream and Zigzag DSE frameworks, found [here](https://zigzag-project.github.io/zigzag/).
